# How to install
Just open the terminal and run
```sh installer.sh```

### Global theme configuration
It has to be manually installed
```Right click Desktop > Add Widgets > Get New Widgets > Download New Plasma Widgets > Download 'Plasma Customization Saver'```


1- Change Guake Terminal shortcut by clicking the icon on the tray to ALT+Â°
- Visual Studio Code automatic installer was disabled, it needs to be manually installed due to conflicts with VSCodium. 
If you care about security and privacy, please use VSCodium and migrate your extensions.

2- P3X One Note is not linked due to personal preferences (official website app is more secure than a unknown widget that behaves the same) 
But if you still wanna download it, run: 
```sudo snap install p3x-onenote```


### Multi USB boot loader WILL NOT install by default, open 'manual-i' folder inside 'ess' one and run:
```sh ventoy.sh```


### Tested only on parrot
Altought this is most likely to work in almost all distros, if something doesn't work properly just try to modify the installer by changing the exec commands
