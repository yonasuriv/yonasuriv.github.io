# Azure Machine Learning - Remote Extension

This extension is complementary to the [Azure Machine Learning](https://aka.ms/aml-ext-get-started) extension and is used to seamlessly connect VS Code to a remote Compute Instance.

Once connected to the compute instance, you can:
- Run and debug Python scripts and Notebooks, executing directly on the CI
- Traverse the remote filesystem and mounted fileshare
- Invoke commands in a remote terminal
- Clone and manage git repos

3. Once you land in VS Code, you'll be prompted to install the Azure ML extension if you do not already have it. If you have an older version of the extension (0.6.17 or less), please upgrade to the latest version and Try Again.

4. The Azure Machine Learning - Remote extension will be used to set up your connection. After invoking the connection from the Studio UI the first time, subsequent connections can be invoked within VS Code using the "Azure ML: Connect to Compute Instance" command.
